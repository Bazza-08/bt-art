                "I had the privilege of growing up as a farmer's daughter in Zimbabwe. The wonderful outdoor life ignited my passion for nature and animals.
                My spare time is spent creating my own artworks. I like to choose subjects that have interesting lighting, especially for pencil work. Good contrast in light and shade can make a pencil drawing very dramatic. I am a slave to accuracy and detail (I think that's the textile designer in me) so you will always find that element in my work too.""
